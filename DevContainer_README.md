What does this project actually do?

Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation of your to-do project, highlighting its features and functionalities:

### Overview

Your to-do project is a web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to manage their to-do lists efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) tasks. 

### Features
